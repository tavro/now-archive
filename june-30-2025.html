        <p>My life is often busy, and I've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. I thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what I'm currently doing. I'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings.

                <p>Summer is here, and naturally, the days have been filling up with all sorts of activities. One of the more exciting things that happened was that my brother and his wife got married! It was a low-key wedding at our summer cabin and it was incredibly wholesome. Unfortunately, just before we headed home, my grandpa fell down the stairs and hit his head pretty badly. I was really worried about him, and still am, to be honest. On a lighter note, my half-sister graduated high school and I got to spend some time with her and her family, which was really nice. As if that weren‚Äôt enough, I also went hiking with my closest friends. We had planned to go to Ombro, but we got absolutely swarmed by bees, flies and other bugs, so we had to call it off and ended up going to Visings√∂ instead. I haven‚Äôt spent time with friends like that in ages, it was honestly super refreshing. For once, I felt kind of at peace. To end the month, nine of my university friends and I went on vacation to Budapest. I had the chance to teach them a bit about Hungarian culture and show them some of my favorite places and activities there. My dad‚Äôs side of the family is from Hungary, so I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of time there over the years. Even though I wasn‚Äôt feeling great mentally during the trip, it was still refreshing. I learned a lot, both about and from my friends.</p>

        <h3>Work üíº</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Things at <a href="https://opera.com/">Opera</a> have been really exciting lately. The summer interns have arrived and I'm mentoring one of them. He's working on some fun projects connected to crypto and it's been genuinely rewarding to support someone in their work. I've also had the chance to contribute to projects with the Web Core team at my office. I really appreciate how flexible the company is, it allows me to grow and explore different areas even when it's not strictly within the scope of my job title. Love that!</p>
        <h3>Organizations üè¢</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My <a href="https://lithehax.se/">ethical hacking organization</a> is still on pause for the summer, but I've been exchanging emails with a few people and companies who are interested in collaborating for the upcoming term. I'll probably share more about that in the future. We're also planning a team-building event next month, so things aren't completely quiet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://lithanian.se">LiTHanian</a>, we're also heading into a summer break, so there's not much of an update here either. Like with LiTHe Hax, we're planning some sort of final team-building activity before the break.</p>
        <h3>Hobby Projects ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For me, having hobbies outside of studying and working is very important. My main hobbies are programming, photography, music, and writing.</p>
        <p>When it comes to programming outside of work, I haven't been doing much lately‚Äî again. But I've been reading quite a few Hacker News articles recently, if that counts, haha. I've also had a lot of ideas and motivation around programming, so we'll see if I actually get around to doing something with it.</p>

                <p>When it comes to photography, I've taken a few shots recently, but mostly I've been planning future photos. I realized I don't have enough high-quality images for my photo album/poem book, so I'm focusing on preparing for that.</p>

        <p>As for writing, I've finalized and polished all the poems I'll be including in my second poetry collection. I'm attaching one of the pieces I'm "especially proud of":</p>
        <div class="poem">
            <p class="stanza">
                i bought these pants because they were half price<br>
                they were corduroy<br>
                brown<br>
                wrinkled in a way that shows i have lived a little<br>
                i found a folded slip of paper<br>
                tucked into the left front pocket<br>
                it was a poem<br>
                written in blue pen<br>
                on lined paper torn from a notebook<br>
                there were no rhymes<br>
                i sat on the floor<br>
                reading someone else's breakdown<br>
                i read it twice<br>
                then a third time<br>
                like a creep<br>
                i do not know who wrote it<br>
                but i folded the poem back up<br>
                exactly how i found it<br>
                and now<br>
                every time i wear these pants<br>
                i like to think<br>
                they left it there on purpose..<br>
                so if you ever see me<br>
                standing still<br>
                in corduroy pants<br>
                for longer than is socially acceptable<br>
                don't worry<br>
                i am just reading the poem again<br>
            </p>

        <h3>Expert Progress üìà</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a> Gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. This notion is based on the research of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>
        <div class="progress-container">

        <p class="gray">I've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. The actual total is likely higher, considering I wrote my first program in 2012! Please note that I include this jokingly; I don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. I haven't given it much thought, and I certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</p>
